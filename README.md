# Advent of Code - 2015

This repository contains my solutions for the 2015 Advent of Code challenges. All challenges will be completed in C and are done purely for fun and skill development.

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- CMake (version 3.28 or higher)
- Make utility (make, ninja, etc.)
- CLion, VS Code, or preferred IDE for editing the code

## Build & Run

This project uses CMake. To build the project:

1. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
2. Configure and build:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
3. Run a specific day's solution (e.g., Day 1):
   ```bash
   cd day-1
   ./day1
   ```
   *You must execute this step from the build folder. (the build folder will contain a folder called day-1)*

## Challenges

| Day | Challenge Title                        | Solution Path | Status |
|-----|----------------------------------------|---------------|--------|
| 1   | Not Quite Lisp                         | `day-1/`      | ✅      |
